Extracting data from the tables

## Files
- `Day_3.sql` â€” SQL script with various `SELECT` queries to retrieve data.

## Description
This script demonstrates how to retrieve data from the `LibraryDB` (created in Task 1, populated in Task 2).
- **`SELECT *`:** Selects all columns from a table.
- **`SELECT (specific)`:** Selects specific columns (e.g., `title`).
- **`WHERE`:** Filters rows based on conditions using operators like `=`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `IS NULL`.
- **`AND / OR`:** Combines multiple filter conditions.
- **`ORDER BY`:** Sorts the results (`ASC` is default, `DESC` is descending).
- **`LIMIT`:** Restricts the number of rows returned by the query.

## How to run
1.  Ensure you have run the `Day_1.sql` (Task 1) and `Day_2.sql` (Task 2) scripts.
2.  Open and run this `Day_3.sql` script. You can run one query at a time to see the different results.
3.  Observe the output in the "Result Grid" for each `SELECT` query.
